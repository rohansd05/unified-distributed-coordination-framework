## Experiment 2 — Multithreading (Phase 3, moduleId: multithreading)

- **Reuse:** the Exp 2 application inside `backend/` (`com.udcf.threadpool`, model, dto, monitoring, controller, config and its 11 test classes); HANDOFF Appendix B Exp 2.
- **Special rules:** `AbortPolicy` (not `CallerRuns`); real SHA-256 work; each node's executor is sized by its `NodeCapacity` (FAST 4 threads x1 work, MEDIUM 2 x2, SLOW 1 x4), queue 200, keep-alive 60 s, thread names `udcf-worker-n<k>-`; how the old `udcf.threadpool` settings map onto per-node capacity is decided in the E2a plan.

### Steps
- [ ] E2a — move the Exp 2 engine into `com.udcf.modules.multithreading` as pure classes sized per node; the 11 existing test classes are moved (never deleted) and pass. Needs: none.
- [ ] E2b — per-node "requests" NodeService on `ports().requests()` (720k) running work on that node's executor. Needs: E2a.
- [ ] E2c — `MultithreadingModule` (lab 2) and `/api/modules/multithreading` endpoints (submit a batch to a node, per-node stats, a backpressure demo); events and metrics; retire the old `/api/multithreading` controller, the old Exp 2 packages and `udcf.node.id`, and list these removals in the Progress log for Rohan; fix registry-dependent tests if this is the first module to register; contract fixtures. Needs: E2b.
- [ ] E2d — build the shared experiment-page kit exactly as in README section 7, then the Multithreading page; verify HANDOFF Section 7 Exp 2 "done when". Needs: E2c.

## Experiment 6 — Load Balancing (Phase 8, moduleId: loadbalancing)

- **Reuse:** `legacy-demos/exp06-load-balancing`; Appendix B Exp 6.
- **Special rules:** no private thread pool: dispatch into each node's Exp 2 executor over TCP (link L3); keep the key finding visible: Round Robin has the most even request counts and the worst finish time.

### Steps
- [ ] E6a — strategies (Round Robin, smooth Weighted Round Robin, Least Connections, Least Response Time = EWMA latency x (in-flight + 1), alpha 0.3), `WorkerInfo`, `DispatchResult`, `PhaseReport`, circuit-breaker reroute, as pure classes. Needs: E2d.
- [ ] E6b — the balancer dispatching over TCP into each node's requests service, with reroute when a worker is down. Needs: E6a, E2b.
- [ ] E6c — `LoadBalancingModule` (lab 6): run a strategy, "compare all four", crash a worker mid-run; events, metrics, fixtures. Needs: E6b.
- [ ] E6d — page and end-to-end check. Needs: E6c.
